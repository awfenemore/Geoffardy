Questions are written as delimited strings, with one text file for each CATEGORY, and at least one question per monetary value within that.
These will NOT be checked by the program, meaning if you write the questions wrong, you are on your own.
The format of the delimited text files is below, with dummy data, for basic questions and for file based questions.
